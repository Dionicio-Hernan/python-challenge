# python-challenge
Both of these tasks were fairly tough. One of my biggest challenges still seems to be If statements. I always seem to get an error and it throws a lot of my subsequent code off. Looping through a list has also been presenting me with some challenges. My loop always seems to get stuck at the first entry and does not seem to carry through the entire list in order to extract the information that I am looking for. 

I am going to study up on both a lot more this week in hopes of catching up a bit. Feel like I am falling behind in these areas of Python.
